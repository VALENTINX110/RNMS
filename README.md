# About
A minecraft datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition (version 1.19.3) that spawns a random mob at a random player every minute!

# How to install
Drag and drop the zip file on the world's datapack folder. Make sure your cheats are enabled on your server!
After that, run the command `/reload`. A huge message will pop up on chat with all the instructions which you can also find bellow!

To stop run the command `/trigger RNMS.switch set -1`!

To customize the time between each spawn, run the command `/scoreboard players set #time_limit RNMS.time [time_amount]` and set the time in seconds multiplied by 20 in 
the filed marked by `[time_amount]`!

Have fun! :D
